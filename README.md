.NET Virtualizer Made By [CursedLand](https://github.com/CursedLand/).

# ðŸŽ€ What does this do
This convert .NET ByteCode (aka CIL) into New Set Of Instructions Which Only Understandable By ILVirtualization Runtime.

# ðŸŽ² Know Clues
- Some Handlers Have Simple Mistakes. (i.e Ldelem_R8, Call, Callvirt, Newobj).
- No Support For Pointer CilOpCodes. (i.e Ldelema, Ldsflda, Ldloca).
- No Support For Exception Handlers.
- Not All Handlers well Tested.
- This Also May Lead to a Noticeable Performance Hit(s).
- Xor is Weak Algorithm.

# ðŸ§© What This Made For ?
- Protecting Very Important And Sensitive Codes. (i.e License Checking Code, API Connections).
- Protecting Code That Implements Algorithms.
